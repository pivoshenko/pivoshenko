## 👋 Hi there!

Hi, I'm **Volodymyr**, a R&D/AI/ML Engineering Lead fascinated by system design, artificial intelligence, and software development. I enjoy building scalable solutions and exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of innovation.

In my current role, I lead the R&D team and drive technical direction across end-to-end systems. I design scalable architectures, translate ideas into production-ready solutions, and support alignment between business stakeholders and team.

In my spare time, I dedicate myself to Open Source and building products, where I freely explore new ideas, collaborate with passionate developers, and give back to the tech community that has shaped my journey.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and playing video games to unwind.

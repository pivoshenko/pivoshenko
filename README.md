## 👋 Hi there!

Hi, I'm **Volodymyr** - R&D/AI/ML Engineering Lead fascinated by AI, system design, and software development.

In my current role, I lead the R&D team and work hands-on with architecture and implementation. I help turn rough ideas into working solutions and keep engineering decisions practical and scalable.

In my spare time, I build side projects and contribute to open source. It is my space to experiment with new tools and architectures, explore ideas, and collaborate with people who care about making things well.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and playing video games to unwind.
